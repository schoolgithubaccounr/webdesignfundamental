            The greeks were well known for their art, focusing mainly on pottery, statues and metalwork. The greeks would focus on natural but idealized versions of the body,
            depictimg mainly nude men.
            The Greeks decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour. 
            Seeing their gods as having human form, there was little distinction between the sacred and the secular in art—the human body was both secular and sacred.

          <div class="desc">The Lady of Auxerre was found in a storage vault in the Museum of Auxerre and was discovered by a Louvre curator named Maxime Collignon in 1907. 
            While no one knew how the statue came to be there, 
            many scholars concur that The Lady of Auxerre represents Persephone, who was the daughter of the mythological being Demeter</div>

          <div class="desc">These ancient Greek statues were found in Delphi in 1893 but originally came from Argos. 
            The famous Greek statues are nude and identically crafted from Parian marble. Inscribed on the base of the statues is the name of the sculptor, Polymedes of Argos. 
            There are two different interpretations of who the statues are meant to represent but both of them are rooted in Greek mythology.</div>

          <div class="desc">This ancient Greek sculpture is also known as The Calf Bearer in English and was created in the Archaic period. 
            It had been discovered in 1864 in the Acropolis of Athens and was reconstructed from fragments that were found during the Persian invasion, 
            therefore, it is not in the best condition since both legs are missing from the knees down.</div>

          <div class="desc">This famous kouros was discovered in the ancient Kerameikos cemetery at a site known as the Sacred Gate in 2002. 
            Unearthed by the German Archeological Institute, the cemetery was part of the potter’s corner of ancient Athens. 
            The statue depicts a male figure that was used for marking graves and crafted from Naxian marble. Standing at just over two meters high, 
            the Greek sculpture was found along with two lions made from marble, pillar fragments, and a sphinx.</div>
