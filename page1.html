        The greeks were well known for their art, focusing mainly on pottery, statues and metalwork. The greeks would focus on natural but idealized versions of the body,
        depictimg mainly men.
        The Greeks decided very early on that the human form was the most important subject for artistic endeavour. 
        Seeing their gods as having human form, there was little distinction between the sacred and the secular in artâ€”the human body was both secular and sacred.<br><br>

    <p>The sculpture of ancient Greece is the main surviving type of fine ancient Greek art. Modern scholarship identifies three major stages in monumental sculpture in 
      bronze and stone: the Archaic, Classical and Hellenistic. At all periods there were great numbers of Greek terracotta figurines and small sculptures in metal 
      and other materials. <br> By the classical period most sculptures were composed almost entirely of marble or bronze

        Ancient Greek pottery stands as a testament to the artistic and cultural achievements of one of history's most influential civilizations. 
        Crafted with meticulous attention to detail and imbued with symbolism, Greek pottery served both practical and aesthetic purposes. 
        From the elegant curves of amphorae to the graceful lines of kylixes, each vessel tells a story of its own. 
        Decorated with intricate patterns, mythological scenes, and everyday life depictions, these vessels offer invaluable insights into ancient Greek life, beliefs, and traditions. 
        Whether used for storing wine, oil, or water, or as ceremonial offerings in religious rites, Greek pottery reflected the sophistication and creativity of its makers. 
        Through the ages, these artifacts have captivated archaeologists, historians, and art enthusiasts alike, serving as windows into the rich tapestry of ancient Greek civilization.
