    Greek philosophy, with its profound inquiries into the nature of existence, knowledge, and ethics, laid the foundation for Western thought. 
    Emerging in the 6th century BCE, philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle delved into fundamental questions about the universe and humanity's place within it. 
    Socrates' emphasis on critical thinking and self-examination, Plato's exploration of ideal forms and the nature of reality, and Aristotle's systematic approach to understanding the natural world are just a few examples of the diverse philosophical schools that flourished in ancient Greece. 
    These thinkers sought to unravel the mysteries of life, offering insights that continue to shape our understanding of ethics, politics, metaphysics, and epistemology. Greek philosophy was not just an intellectual pursuit but a way of life, encouraging individuals to engage in reasoned discourse, pursue wisdom, and strive for virtue. 
    Its enduring legacy can be seen in the enduring influence it has had on subsequent philosophical traditions and its ongoing relevance in contemporary debates about truth, morality, and the nature of existence.

    <p>Socrates is the most well known philosopher from Athens. He was incredibly influentel being the credited as the creator of western philosophy as we know it. 
      He was one of the first "Moral philosophers" of the ethical tradition of thought. Socrates was an enigmatic figure, He would never record his teachings, the records we have
      of his teachings are taken from accounts of his students such as plato, who is an incredibly recogniseable figure in his own right. Socrates was the first person to 
      use a method of systemic doubt and and questioning of others to elicit a clear expression of truth.
