    Ancient Greece is well known for it Philosophers. Many of the ideas and western Philosophy was created or based on philosphy of the ancient greeks.
    In ancient Greece, philosophers contemplated and theorized about many different ideas such as human nature, ethics, and moral dilemmas. 
    Ancient Greek philosophers can be categorized into three groups: the Pre-Socratics, the Socratics, and the Post-Socratics.
     
    <ul>
      <li>Pre-Socratics are philosophers that were alive before socrates</li>
      <li>The Socratics are philosophers that were alive or studied under socrates</li>
      <li>Post-Socratics are philosophers that lived after socrates</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Socrates is the most well known philosopher from Athens. He was incredibly influentel being the credited as the creator of western philosophy as we know it. 
      He was one of the first "Moral philosophers" of the ethical tradition of thought. Socrates was an enigmatic figure, He would never record his teachings, the records we have
      of his teachings are taken from accounts of his students such as plato, who is an incredibly recogniseable figure in his own right. Socrates was the first person to 
      use a method of systemic doubt and and questioning of others to elicit a clear expression of truth.
