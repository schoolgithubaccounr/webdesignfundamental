                <h2>Location of Greece</h2>
                
            <p>Located in southern Europe, Greece is made up of the mainland and hundreds of small islands spread throughout the Ioanian, Aegean, and Mediterranean Seas. 
              As a peninsula, the people of Greece took advantage of living by the sea.<br>
              The Greeks, like many other ancient civilizations, felt deeply connected to the land they lived on. 
              While living on the land helped to develop a strong sense of pride in their country, 
              the distance between the islands and the mountains did not help to support unity in Greece. 
              The Minoans and Mycenaeans of ancient Greece used their geography to their advantage.<br>
              The Greek mainland is approximately 80% mountains, which allowed the city-states to develop independently of each other. 
              The eastern part of Greece is sloping hills that allow agriculture to grow in this region. The western region of Greece was mainly Islands.
              With Greece being surrounded by the sea on 3 sides, the people would use this to their advantage and set up trades routes between cities, 
              they became good mariners.
