          <h1>What was ancient Greece</h1>
          <p>Ancient Greece, the birthplace of democracy, was the source of some of the greatest literature, architecture, 
              science and philosophy in Western civilization, and home to beautiful historical sites like the Acropolis and the Parthenon. 
              The ancient Greece we think of Existed from 800 BC to 146 BC. 
              There are 3 main periods in ancient Greek history, Archaic period, 800–490 BC. Classical period, 490–323 BC. Hellenistic period, 323–146 BC.</p>

            <p>The Greeks made important contributions to philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and medicine.
              Literature and theatre was an important aspect of Greek culture and influenced modern drama.
              The Greeks were known for their sophisticated sculpture and architecture.
              Greek culture influenced the Roman Empire and many other civilizations, and it continues to influence modern cultures today.</p>

            <p>Located in southern Europe, Greece is made up of the mainland and hundreds of small islands spread throughout the Ioanian, Aegean, and Mediterranean Seas. 
              As a peninsula, the people of Greece took advantage of living by the sea.
              <ul>

                <li>They were fishermen</li>
                <li>They were traders</li>
                <li>They were sailors</li>
              
              </ul>
              
              The mountains in Greece did not have fertile soil good for growing crops, like in Mesopotamia, but the mild climate allowed for some farming.<br>
              They grew:
              <ul>
                <li>Wheat</li>
                <li>Barley</li>
                <li>Olives</li>
                <li>Grapes</li>

              </ul>

              The Greeks, like many other ancient civilizations, felt deeply connected to the land they lived on. While living on the land helped to develop a strong sense of pride in their country, 
              the distance between the islands and the mountains did not help to support unity in Greece. 
              The Minoans and Mycenaeans of ancient Greece used their geography to their advantage.</p>
